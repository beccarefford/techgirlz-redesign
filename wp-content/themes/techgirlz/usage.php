          At TechGirlz, our mission is to change the face of tech, so we ask that you
          please not change our face (logo). We have had some wonderful volunteer
          attorneys who spent a lot of time and effort processing the trademark for
          our logo and we would really hate to have to ask them to do more pro bono
          work going after trademark violators, so let’s all play nice and follow
          the rules.

          just like any other brand, we do have a few guidelines we ask that you adhere
          to. Thanks in advance for being considerate and helping us
          protect our brand image!
